### Creating a New User:
```bash
./user_administrator/create_new_user.sh
```

You will be prompted for the username, home directory, shell, and group details. After completion, the user will be added to the system.

### Backing up a Directory:

This will prompt you for the directory to back up and the destination directory for the backup file. A timestamped `.tar.gz` file will be created.

## üìë Help System

Each task comes with a detailed help script. To access the help system, type help in the main menu and select the corresponding help option.
